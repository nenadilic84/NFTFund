# NFT Fund Project

The project is intended to demonstrate how NFTs can be used to represent an investment fund. User can buy shares by minting NFTs and supplying the amount of shares he is purchasing. These investments can then be taken by the Treasury manager to generate income for the NFT holders and at the end, the Treasury manager can instruct the contract to airdrop the earnings to the NFT holders proportional to shares NFT holds.
